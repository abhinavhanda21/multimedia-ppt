Decoding is the opposite process -- the conversion of an encoded format back into the original sequence of characters. Encoding and decoding are used in data communications, networking, and storage. The term is especially applicable to radio (wireless) communications systems.</p></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="3" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="4800" data-y="0" data-z="0"><p>The terms encoding and decoding are often used in reference to the processes of analog-to-digital conversion and digital-to-analog conversion. In this sense, these terms can apply to any form of data, including text, images, audio, video, multimedia, computer programs, or signals in sensors, telemetry, and control systems. Encoding should not be confused with encryption, a process in which data is deliberately altered so as to conceal its content. Encryption can be done without changing the particular code that the content is in, and encoding can be done without deliberately concealing the content.</p></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="4" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="6400" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="difference-between-encoding-decoding">Difference Between Encoding &amp; Decoding</h1><p>Encoding is the process of translating data between two formats according to a set of rules or a formula. For example, you can encode "abc" to "ABC" using lowercase-to-uppercase rules. Decoding is the inverse process. You can decode "ABC" to "abc" using the same set of rules. There are many different applications for data encoding and decoding. Encryption, for example, is a form of encoding that uses a key. Without the key, the encoded data can't be decoded. Video data is encoded to make it smaller so that high-definition streams of video can be viewed over the Internet.</p></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="5" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="8000" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="media-encoding">Media Encoding</h1><p>Encoding is commonly used to reduce the size of audio and video data. A coder-decoder program, called a codec, applies a series of mathematical algorithms that eliminate redundant data. For example, suppose a file contained the data "ABCDQABC." Codec #1's algorithm might be to replace "ABC" with "Z." The resulting file would be "ZDQZ," which is 50 percent smaller than the original file. Codec #2's algorithm might replace "ABC?" with "Y" and "?ABC" with "X," where "?" indicates any character. The resulting file would be "YX," which is 75 percent smaller than the original file.</p></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="6" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="9600" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="media-decoding">Media Decoding</h1><p>Decoding uses the same codec to reconstruct the original file from an encoded file. For example, applying Codec #1 to "ZDQZ" in reverse replaces "Z" with "ABC" to create the original file "ABCDQABC." Codec #1, which was 50 percent smaller, is called a lossless codec because decoding always recreates the original file. Codec #2 decodes "YX" with "ABC??ABC," and then tries to guess what the missing characters are. The codec might guess "DE," which results in "ABCDEABC." Codec #2, which was 75 percent smaller, is a lossy codec, because the decoding process might create a file that's close to the original, but not identical.</p></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="7" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="11200" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="id1">Encoder and Decoder</h1><img src="images/encode.jpeg" width="800px" class="aligncn"></img></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="8" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="12800" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="color-spaces">Color Spaces</h1><p>Color is the perceptual result of light in the visible region of the spectrum, having
wavelengths in the region of 380 nm to 780 nm. The human retina has three
types of color photoreceptor cells cone, which respond to incident radiation with
somewhat different spectral response curves. Because there are exactly three
types of color photoreceptor, three numerical components are necessary and
theoretically sufficient to describe a color.</p></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="9" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="14400" data-y="0" data-z="0"><p>For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model.

Any color space based on such a 24-bit RGB model is thus limited to a range of 256&#xD7;256&#xD7;256 &#x2248; 16.7 million colors.

Component video can be contrasted with composite video (NTSC, PAL or SECAM) in which all the video information is combined into a single line level signal that is used in analog television.</p></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="48" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="76800" data-y="0" data-z="0"><p><strong>CONNECTORS</strong></p><img src="images/connectors.jpg" width="600px" class="aligncn"></img></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="49" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="78400" data-y="0" data-z="0"><p><strong>VGA CABLE</strong></p><img src="images/Vga-cable.jpg" width="800px" class="aligncn"></img></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="50" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="80000" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="hdmi-high-definition-multimedia-interface">HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)</h1><p>HDMI is a proprietary audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant source device, such as a display controller, to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device.
